Working Fridges creates buildable workshop objects which will refrigerate every drink Drinking Buddy knows (including DLC beverages) and more.  It also disables the busted fridge in the Diamond City market and replaces it with a working fridge to demo the behavior.
Cooling takes three in-game hours.  Buildable fridges require radiant power to operate and drinks in them will warm if power is lost.  The workshop objects are in the Furniture > Containers menu.  By default, they are:
 * a blue pre-war fridge (labeled "Refrigerator"),
 * a metal post-war fridge (also labeled "Refrigerator"),
 * a Nuka-Cola machine (labeled "Refrigerated Nuka-Cola Machine"),
 * a milk machine (labeled "Refrigerated Milk Machine"),
 * and an ice machine (labeled "Refrigerated Ice Machine").
 
You can recognize the objects by their description which will make mention of both the need for radiant power and the requirement of a cryo cell to build them.

DLC compatibility:
 * The hard requirement of Far Harbor to use Working Fridges has been eliminated
 * The buildable Refrigerated Vim Machine remains available for building (in the same menu as the other fridges) should Far Harbor be installed
 * All Nuka-World beverages work out-of-the-box because they are added to Drinking Buddy's recipe list when Nuka-World is installed
 
Optional Third-party compatibility features (obviously requiring the named mods to function:)
 * Modular Kitchen (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17141/) by evanpox, Working Fridges will add a sub-menu to Modular Kitchen's menu in Furniture called "Working Fridges" with fridges matching the options provided by Modular Kitchen.
 * Wasteland Imports (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3793) by Mikado and customtemplar, Sunset Sarsaparilla (though added to Drinking Buddy already) has been added to Working Fridges to prevent future compatibility issues with other mods modifying Drinking Buddy
 * Bit Better Fallout (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29056) by Bit Better Mods, V-Energy drink added to Working Fridges and the V-Energy drink machine is buildable (also in the Furniture > Containers menu)
 * Lima Detachment (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29042) by Col_Mustard, Add the Patriotic Pilsner to Working Fridges
 * Altairp's Animal Farm (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23421) by Altairp, Adds the various milk beverages to Working Fridges
 * Soda Heaven (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29763) by MrMod89, Adds the sodas and other beverages to Working Fridges
 
If you would like compatibility with a plugin not already listed, ask.  We make no promises, but there's a great chance your request will be implemented.
 
A holotape named "[Settings] Working Fridges" (so that it will appear in the settings folder if you're using the appropriate sorting and UI mods) has been added.  It will facilitate uninstalling Working Fridges properly as well as managing third-party compatibility options should you wish to uninstall any plugins they rely on.
