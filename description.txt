Working Fridges creates five workshop objects which refrigerate beverages placed in them.  It also disables the busted fridge in the Diamond City market and replaces it with a working fridge.

These fridges work with all recipes registered with Drinking Buddy.  This means that any DLC recipes will just work in the fridges from this mod.  This mod also includes custom recipes for Ice Cold Purified Water, Ice Cold Institute Bottled Water, and Ice Cold Deezer's Lemonade.

Cooling works in three hour cycles.  The workshop fridges will produce warm beverages from cool ones if they lose power.

Working Fridges makes use of Recipe Container (which is bundled in Working Fridges) and requires the Far Harbor DLC because of the VIM Machine asset.

This has been done before.  If you're inclined to pass this mod by, then do so!  It was originally intended as a proof-of-concept and example mod to illustrate how to use the Recipe Container library, but it was released as a stand-alone package because it provides actual functionality.

The workshop fridge objects can be found under Furniture > Containers.
